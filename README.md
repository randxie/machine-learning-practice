# machine-learning-practice

### Introduction
This repo tries to re-organize some code I wrote to improve my understanding to machine learning algorithms. 
It is written for study purpose and not intended to be super efficient. 
This repos is also inspired by a top kaggler bestfitting's post "read papers everyday and implement some of them".
